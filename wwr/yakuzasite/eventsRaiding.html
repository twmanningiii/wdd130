                We have a monthly Calander that we use to schedule weekly raids, dungeons' and PVP events. Depending on the number of members who sign up, we can run multiple groups. Please be aware that should a group have the minimum necessary players and there are more than can join, but not enough to make a second, two things may happen; 
                You may have to wait to run the event. What does that mean? Depending on the type of event and the time that it takes (Raids specifically) raid leaders may do a second run right after.
                If there are no leaders/guides available after the first event, you may have to wait until the following day/week to run your desired raid or dungeon. Everyone needs to put in “The Grind” to better everyone’s gaming experience.  Be active, be an asset to the group you are with (not just gaming but encouraging) being positive is our focus and relaxing when others are inexperienced is a better experience than getting frustrated!
