    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This is a website portal for Clan Yakuza, a Destiny 2 community. This site is dedicated to the clan members and
      to recruting new ones. The site will provide information on who the clan is and what it can offer to perspctive
      clan members.</p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience is Destiny 2 players that are looking for a deeper     experience within the game. By joining a clan they
    will have automatic access to raids and player Vs Player competitions that wouldn't otherwise be available to solo
    players. Players would be able to schedule play times with the clan and set up their own clan raids inviting any
    and all the clan members.</p> <!-- change this -->

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>

    <img src="https://twmanningiii.github.io/wdd130/wwr/yakuzasite/images/homewire.jpg" alt="Home page wireframe" />


    <p>We are a clan of eclectic players who want to encourage team play. Our goal is to recruit players across all
      platforms (PC, XBOX, PS, and Stadia). With the advantage of cross play enabled, our clan can bring a wider range
      of players and play styles.
    </p>

    <p>We are an “end game content” clan, meaning we look to do all raids available within the game to the point of
      being able to “farm” the raids. To that end we will “sherpa” new players and teach each raid that we are running
      or that you have a need/desire to run.
    </p>

    <p>While we do every aspect of player verses environment (PVE) we have not forgotten our path to player verses
      player (PVP) dominance! PVP is a focus of many of our clan members and we encourage all members to team up with
      our seasoned veterans to duel with other random teams in the Crucible, Gambit and Trials.
    </p>
    <p>Our clan is an 18 year or older clan. Why? Because we are a more mature group of players and do not wish to
      engage in the sometimes petty and immature acts that can often occur with younger players. While this is a
      standard rule, exceptions can be made on an individual bases and with the recommendation of current clan members.
    </p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Events and Raiding </h2>
    <p>We have a monthly Calander that we use to schedule weekly raids, dungeons' and PVP events. Depending on the
      number of members who sign up, we can run multiple groups. Please be aware that should a group have the minimum
      necessary players and there are more than can join, but not enough to make a second, two things may happen;
    </p>

    <p>You may have to wait to run the event. What does that mean? Depending on the type of event and the time that it
      takes (Raids specifically) raid leaders may do a second run right after.
    </p>

    <p>If there are no leaders/guides available after the first event, you may have to wait until the following day/week
      to run your desired raid or dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone needs to put in “The Grind” to better everyone’s gaming experience. Be active, be an asset to the group
      you are with (not just gaming but encouraging) being positive is our focus and relaxing when others are
      inexperienced is a better experience than getting frustrated!

    <h2>Rules and Membership </h2>
    <p>

      -Ages 18+ (members younger than 18 will be considered case by case only)
    </p>

    <p>-Need to be ACTIVE and INTERACTIVE. If you can't do either, you're better off going SOLO.
    </p>

    <p>-MICs are REQUIRED! We use Game chat for cross platform raids and have a Discord channel:
      https://discord.gg/86BmVAz8 for alternate coms.
    </p>

    <p>-No Toxicity! No talking down to members, no racism allowed! IF YOU CAN DISH OUT A JOKE, LEARN TO TAKE A JOKE!
    </p>
    <p>-Enjoy the game When, How and with Who you want to.
    </p>

    <p>-Contact Admins for more info/request to join.
    </p>
    <p>Approval Required--Membership requires approval.
    </p>
    <h2>Clan Roster</h2>

    <p>We keep a current list of clan members by gamer tag. This is all that is needed for casual game play and to be
      seen by the general public. Membership in the clan will require your real name and a valid email address. Why is
      this required? As stated in our “rules” section, it is to be certain that you can be privately contacted by the
      admins and if necessary, provide you with feedback on another members concerns if there has been a conflict. There
      are always two sides to every story, and we want to be certain that we have all the facts before any decision is
      made to ban anyone from the clan. (Remember the “NO Toxicity”!)
