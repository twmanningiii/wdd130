            <h1>Membership and Rules</h1>
            <p>
                -Ages 18+ (members younger than 18 will be considered case by case only)
                <br>
                -MICs are REQUIRED! We use Game chat for cross platform raids and have a Discord channel:
                https://discord.gg/86BmVAz8 for alternate coms.
                <br>
                -No Toxicity! No talking down to members, no racism allowed! IF YOU CAN DISH OUT A JOKE, LEARN TO TAKE A
                JOKE!
                <br>
                -Enjoy the game When, How and with Who you want to.
                <br>
                -Contact Admins for more info/request to join.
                Approval Required--Membership requires approval.
            </p>
            <p>We keep a current list of clan members by gamer tag. This is all that is needed for casual game play and
                to be
                seen by the general public. Membership in the clan will require your real name and a valid email
                address. Why is
                this required? As stated in our “rules” section, it is to be certain that you can be privately contacted
                by the
                admins and if necessary, provide you with feedback on another members concerns if there has been a
                conflict. There
                are always two sides to every story, and we want to be certain that we have all the facts before any
                decision is
                made to ban anyone from the clan. (Remember the “NO Toxicity”!)
