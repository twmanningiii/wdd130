            <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
            <br>
            <p2>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was
                given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
                number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they
                never left.
                <br>
                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed
                rivers in the United States. As a free-flowing river, the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
                early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower,
                warmer water more.

            <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
            <br>
            <p2>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river
                flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery,
                and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just
                outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of
                prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                <br>
                Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days. Desolation Canyon has been recognized
                as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon
                tells.

            <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
            <br>
            <p2>This is the granddaddy of all canyons and the granddaddy of all river trips. You will never forget your
                visit to the Grand Canyon.
                <br>
                Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly
                unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids but
                with side canyons and ancient Indian ruins accessible only by river.
                <br>
                CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically
                rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most
                people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
