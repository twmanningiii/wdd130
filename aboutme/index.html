    <h2>Introdution to Tom Manning</h2>

    <h3>Hello, I'm Tom, and from the Seattle, Washington area.<h3>  
        
        <p>I'm 59 and married to Lisaye who is 53, we have a 12-year-old son Tai together, and two daughters, Hallie 31 married to Chris with our two grandchildren Rory five, and Memphis who is three, and Alyssa 33 married to Ben, they have 5 Jack Russelâ€™s, CRAZY Right! And recently a beautiful addition of Bowdrie just 6 weeks old to my grandchildren!  Our girls are from my previous marriage. Both Lisaye and I have been previously married.</p>


        <p>Lisaye and I met in Jail.....(Now that makes you stop and think for a minute...LOL, you can't get much more unique than that!) Lisaye and I have worked in law enforcement for 29 and 28 years respectively. Lisaye is a Corrections Commander running one of two jails for King County in and around Seattle, previously going through all the ranks of the department from Officer, Sergeant,  Captain, Major, and now Commander. I am a Corrections Sergeant and have been one for over 22 years.  If it happened here in the Seattle area in the last 29 years, we were probably involved.</p>  
        
        <p>I attended BYU right out of High School in 1981, attending for three semesters before going on to the Netherlands Amsterdam mission. I returned to BYU in 1985/86 but left for a career selling insurance. A mistake that I regret not finishing my undergraduate degree then. Nine and a half years of running my insurance agency with five employees and I had had enough. I sold my business and sought a career in law enforcement. That's where I am today.</h3>
        
        <h3>With this and my other courses, I am focusing on finishing my degree.  I have gone from Microbiology with Pre-Med emphasis major in my early years of study to computers, hardware, IT, and with luck, programming and front and back end web design.</p>
        
        <p>Computers have always been a hobby of mine, building, tinkering fixing, and toying around with Linux and MS OS since the mid-1980's and I am looking forward to this course!</p>
        
        <p>You can read more on my profile if you wish to, If you have read this far, you might get the hint I can go on a bit when I post or write.</p>
        
        <p>Looking forward to this class and working with you all! I have my LinkedIn and Facebook linked on my profile page but if you need to contact me directly you can use twm332@protonmail.com</p>
